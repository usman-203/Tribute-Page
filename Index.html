    <ul>
        <li><b>1914</b> - Born in Cresco, Iowa</li>
        <li><b>1933</b> - Leaves his family's farm to attend the University of Minnesota, thanks<br> to a Depression era program</li>
                known as the "National Youth Administration"</li>
        <li><b>1935</b> - Has to stop school and save up more money. Works in the Civilian <br>Conservation Corps, helping
                starving Americans. "I saw how food changed <br>them", he said. "All of this left scars on me."
        <li><b>1937</b> - Finishes university and takes a job in the US Forestry Service</li>
        <li><b>1938</b> - Marries wife of 69 years Margret Gibson. Gets laid off due to budget <br>cuts. Inspired by Elvin
                Charles<br> Stakman, he returns to school study under Stakman, who teaches him about breeding pest-resistent
                plants.</li>
        <li><b>1941</b> - Tries to enroll in the military after the Pearl Harbor attack, but is <br>rejected. Instead, the
                military asked his lab <br>to work on waterproof glue, DDT to control malaria, disinfectants, and other
                applied science.</li>
        <li><b>1942</b> - Receives a Ph.D. in Genetics and Plant Pathology</li>
        <li><b>1944</b> - Rejects a 100% salary increase from Dupont, leaves behind his <br>pregnant wife, and flies to Mexico
                to head a new plant pathology program.<br> Over the next 16 years, his team breeds 6,000 different strains
                of disease<br> resistent wheat - including different varieties for each major climate on Earth.</li>
        <li><b>1945</b> - Discovers a way to grown wheat twice each season, doubling wheat<br> yields
        <li><b>1953</b> - crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat with a high-yeidling <br>American breed, creating a
                strain that responds well to fertilizer. It goes on to<br> provide 95% of Mexico's wheat.</li>
        <li><b>1962</b> - Visits Delhi and brings his high-yielding strains of wheat to the Indian <br>subcontinent in time to
                help mitigate mass starvation due to a rapidly <br>expanding population</li>
        <li><b>1970</b> - receives the Nobel Peace Prize</li>
        <li><b>1983</b> - helps seven African countries dramatically increase their maize and<br> sorghum yields</li>
        <li><b>1984</b> - becomes a distinguished professor at Texas A&M University</li>
        <li><b>2005</b> - states "we will have to double the world food supply by 2050." Argues <br>that genetically modified
                crops are the only way<br> we can meet the demand, as we run out of arable land. Says that GM crops are not
                inherently dangerous <br>because "we've been genetically modifying plants and animals for a long <br>time. Long
                before we called it science, people were selecting the best breeds."</li>
        <li><b>2009</b> - dies at the age of 95.</li>
    </ul>
    <p id="ASAD">"Borlaug's life and achievement are testimony to the far-reaching contribution<br> that one man's towering intellect, persistence and scientific vision can make to <br>human peace and progress."</p>

<blockquote>-- Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh</blockquote>
